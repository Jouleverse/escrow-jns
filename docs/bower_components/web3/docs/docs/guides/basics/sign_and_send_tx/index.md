# Sign and Send Transaction

You can sign and send transactions in different ways.

-   [Local wallet signing](./local_wallet)
-   [Using raw transaction](./raw)
-   [Using wallet of Eth Node](./wallet_of_eth_node)

For each of them you can use [Web3PromiEvent](./promi_event) to catch extra transaction's events
